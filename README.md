# TicTacToe_Game
My coding journey continues! Another very typical beginner project...

## Coding Concepts
- A little bit of everything from string manipulation to managing user input to managing lists
- Quite interesting to code the computer's strategy
- Update: after my success with using pygame for a [wordle clone](https://github.com/kawaiimah/Wordle_Clone), I thought to do up a simple one for this tic tac toe game. Making a grey X appear on mouse hover was an idea I was quite happy to include.

## Notes
The strategy I coded for the computer should be able to tie (or even win) most games, but there are weaknesses that I deliberately decided not to address (otherwise how boring would it be)! There is a way for you to win every time, as well as another way where you'd win 25% of the time, see if you could them =)

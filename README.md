# TicTacToe_Game
My coding journey continues! Another very typical beginner project...

## Coding Concepts
- A little bit of everything from string manipulation to managing user input to managing lists
- Quite interesting to code the computer's strategy

## Notes
The strategy I coded for the computer should be able to tie (or even win) most games, but there is a weakness that I deliberately decided not to address (otherwise how boring would it be)! See if you could find way to beat the computer =)
